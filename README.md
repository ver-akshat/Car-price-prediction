This is a simple project predicting the prices of cars based on various parameters . I am using an already available dataset for this .
The dataset was obtained from Kaggle. 
I made 2 notebooks in this. in first one I implemented simple linear regression from scratch and did some analysis.
In second notebook, I tried out various regression algoritms like: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, XGBoost Regressor and finally Voting regressor.
The best accuracy was obtained by voting regressor.
Then I dumped the model into a pickle file.
Then I deployed the model as a webapp using Flask Framework.
The future plan is to deploy it in a cloud environment using some other tools.
